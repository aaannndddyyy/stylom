Description: Command line utility for stylometric text analysis
 This is a tool to facilitate the stylometric analysis of texts.
 It could be used for academic disambiguation of disputed authorship,
 and to help identify plagiarists, astroturfers, sockpuppets and
 guerilla marketers. Another possible use case is as an assistance
 to the anonymisation of writing style.  Every author has their own
 unique writing style, and if enough writing examples are available
 then it's possible to construct a quantitative model of their
 style which can be compared against others.
