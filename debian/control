Description: Command line utility for stylometric text analysis
 Tool to facilitate the stylometric analysis of texts. It could be used for
 academic disambiguation of disputed authorship, and to help identify
 plagiarists, astroturfers, sockpuppets and guerilla marketers. Another
 possible use case is as an assistance to the anonymisation of writing
 style.  Every author has their own unique writing style, and if enough
 writing examples are available then it's possible to construct a
 quantitative model of their style which can be compared against others.
